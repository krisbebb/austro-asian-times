Note for SQLite: SQLite treats inverted commas literally with importing CSV formats. If you download the CSV from 'openflights' you'll find inverted commas encapsulating each value. They have been stripped for this exercise.

Some the original data from 'openflight' contained values with with \N. These have been replaced with a blank for this exercise.
